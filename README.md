# SmartKid
This is repo for my SmartKid Learning Applcation built with love for my three kids to follow the learning journey.
 Goal: "Build and launch a custom smart learning app in 8 weeks for my three children: 
 ages 1, 4, and 7, featuring age-specific modules (sensory play, early learning, and foundational skills), interactive content, and basic progress tracking, using the Meteor framework for  real-time interactivity and mobile readiness."
